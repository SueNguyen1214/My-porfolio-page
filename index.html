            <h3> My experience</h3>
            <p>I have been working in the accounting field for over 6 years and I'm finishing up my B.S degree in Accounting this semester. While majority of my peers want to become the next CPAs,I have found my calling in coding and developing website.</p>
            <p>My coding journey has just started and I still have a long way to go. Everything has been challenging but exciting and I can't wait to see what I can achieve at the end of this road.</p>
